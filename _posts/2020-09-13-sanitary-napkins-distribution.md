description: Educating about Menstrual Hygiene for Unprivileged Women staying in slum and distribution of Sanitary Napkins
---
Menstruation and menstrual practices are still clouded by taboos and socio-cultural restrictions resulting in women remaining ignorant of the scientific facts and hygienic health practices which sometimes result into adverse health outcomes. We the members of Rotaract Club of Banashanakari  tried to create a change by educating them about menstrual hygiene and its importance. we also provided them Sanitary napkins and asked them to avoid use of cloth pads for a safer and healthier bleeding.
