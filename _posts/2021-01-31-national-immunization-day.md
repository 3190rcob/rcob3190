Eradicating Polio is the aim of a multinational public health effort begun in 1988, led by the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund and the Rotary Foundation. As Rotaractors, we collaborated with Rotary Bangalore Banashankari on National Immunization Day and vaccinated the kids within the age of 7 years in Yarabnagar Government Hospital. RCoB has been contributing to eradicate polio virus since 2015.
