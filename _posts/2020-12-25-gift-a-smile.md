Food distribution is frequently organized to supply vital sustenance to individuals and communities experiencing food insecurity and hunger, particularly during periods of crisis or poverty.

In an effort to address this issue and provide a solution, the Rotaract Club of Banashankari, in collaboration with Akshaya Anna Dasoha, has initiated a program to offer food donations to caregivers and family members visiting their relatives admitted to Nimhans and Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Hospital.
